document_parser.py

This module contains the DocumentParser class, responsible for ingesting a single
PDF file. It uses the PyMuPDF (fitz) library for its superior speed and features.

The core logic follows the "Structure-First" approach:
1.  It first attempts to extract the document's Table of Contents (ToC) to get an
    author-intended list of sections, their titles, and page numbers.
2.  If no ToC is available, it falls back to a page-by-page sectioning model,
    ensuring the system can handle any PDF.
3.  It then extracts the full text of the document and maps it to the
    identified sections.
